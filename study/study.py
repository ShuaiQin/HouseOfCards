"""
[Done] 1. Get user scheduling input and make a plan for user
(the input could be: "Complete within XX days", "Complete XX words a day")
(Complete XX words a day is much more simple and realizable)

(this plan probably needs consider the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve)

2. User daily progress -> compare with planned progress
(daily progress includes: known words, unknown words)

if exceed
    re schedule based on the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve
if behind
    re schedule based on the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve

Another Function:

3. Show Known Words and Unknown Words (How many unknown words left)

4. Show How many days left to complete

5. Show progress bar

[Done] 6. Generate a quiz (for all repo)
